# Hide Data Footprints
This is an email spam/ham classifier that is trained using privacy-preserving federated learning.<br>
![concept](https://github.com/reenasheoran/Hide-Data-Footprints/blob/main/static/concept.png)
## Motivation


## Federated Learning
Federated learning is about a model going into a secure environment and learning how to solve a problem without needing the data to move anywhere.<br>
## Data Collection
The data has be taken from http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/, which is in preprocessed form.
# Application
First, it means in order to participate in the 
deep learning supply chain, people don’t technically have to send their data to anyone. 
Valuable models in healthcare, personal management, and other sensitive areas can be 
trained without requiring anyone to disclose information about themselves. In theory, 
people could retain control over the only copy of their personal data (at least as far as deep 
learning is concerned).
This technique will also have a huge impact on the competitive landscape of deep learning 
in corporate competition and entrepreneurship. Large enterprises that previously wouldn’t 
(or couldn’t, for legal reasons) share data about their customers can potentially still earn 
revenue from that data.
